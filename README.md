# k-Nearest-neighbor
# In this project we have used necessary libraries first like numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib for visualization.
# The dataset used is Social_Network_ads.csv
# KNN comes under supervised machine learning technique which can be used to solve both classfication and regression problems.
# First, we have checked basic information about the data like checking null values, outlier, describe() function , info() function., correlation using corr() function.
# Second, visualization using seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot.
# Label Encoder to convert categorical variables into numeric.
# From sklearn imported train_test_split to split the data in 80% and 20%
# Seperate dependent and independent variables.
# Training the model, Testing using 20% of the remaining data, checking confusion matrix and accuracy score.
